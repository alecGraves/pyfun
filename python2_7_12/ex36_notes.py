#						Rules:
#######################################################
#
### If statements: ###
#
# Every if-statement needs an else.
#
# If the else should never run, use a die function
#	to print out error msg and exit.
#
# Never nest if-statement smore than two deep
# 	and try to keep it at one deep.
#
# Put a line before and after each block 
#	of if-elif-else.
#
# Keep boolean tests simple. If they are complex, 
# 	move calculations to earlier in the function
#	and store the result in a well-named variable.
#
#
### Loops: ###
#
# Use a while-loop only to loop forever.
#
# In all other cases, use a for-loop.
#
#
### Debugging: ###
#
# Use print before attempting to use a debugger
#
# Work on the program in parts. Do not write a 
#	massive amount of code before testing it.
#	code a little, run a little, fix a little
#
### Development (WorkFlow): ###
#
# 1. Write down what needs to be done
#
# 2. Pick the easiest thing
#
# 3. Write english comments in the source file 
#		outlining how you would accomplish the task
#
# 4. Write some of the code under the english comments
#
# 5. Quickly run the script to test if the code worked
#
# 6. keep working in a cycle of wirting some code, 
#		running to see if it worksm and fixing it.
#
# 7. Cross off that task, pick the next easiest task,
#		repeat.
